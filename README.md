# Simple Chess Game built in java

Playing around with swing a little


games for the most part functional


There are some random glitches where everything just goes random. Re clicking it seems to fix it. 


If pawns reach the other side, it defaults to changing them into a queen (I know this it not right). 


Need to add a way to identify when some one is in check
